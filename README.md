Financial Performance Analytics | Pricing, Profitability & Risk Analysis

Completed a Financial Performance Analytics project analyzing revenue, cost structures, discounts, profitability, and segment performance. The goal was to 
evaluate how pricing, discounts, and cost variability interact to influence financial outcomes across products and regions.

Key insights:
- Profitability was highly concentrated within a small subset of products and segments
- Discounting increased volume but often eroded margins without proportional revenue gains
- Premium products showed lower demand elasticity than expected
- Certain regions delivered higher revenue retention despite similar cost structures

This project strengthened my ability to link financial metrics with strategic decision-making rather than isolated reporting.
